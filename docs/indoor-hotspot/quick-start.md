### Box Contents
Your Nebra Helium Hotspot comes with the following items:

* SMA LoRa Antenna
* Worldwide 12V 1.5A Power Adapter
* 1M CAT5 Ethernet Cable

### Preparing Your Nebra Indoor Hotspot

**Step 1:** First screw in the included antenna into the connector on the back of the hotspot.

**Step 2:** Next find a suitable location for your Hotspot to be positioned, to provide the best coverage we recommend placing it near a window just out of direct sunlight. You’ll need to be near a mains power source too.

**Step 3:** If you are using a wired ethernet connection, connect an ethernet cable between a router or switch and the ethernet jack on the Hotspot.

**Step 4:** Fit the appropriate power plug for your country onto the universal power supply and plug it into a mains outlet.

**Step 5:** Finally connect the DC Jack from the power supply into the power receptacle on the Hotspot.

You should then see the lower LED on the back of the unit turn on, the hotspot will now take up to 5 minutes to configure for it’s first boot.

The upper light will turn on when it is ready to continue for configuration.

If you have connected it to a wired ethernet connection this process may take slightly longer as it’ll also perform firmware updates as soon as it gets a connection to the internet.

## Configuring Your Nebra Indoor Hotspot

To configure your Hotspot you will require the Helium Network application installed on a Mobile Phone and for you to have gone through the account setup process to continue.

**Step 1:** Open the Helium application and login, then press hotspots.

**Step 2:** Next click Set up Hotspot , from here you will want to select Nebra Indoor Hotspot.

**Step 3:** Follow the steps of setting up the hotspot until you reach the scan for hotspots page.

**Step 4:** Push the button on the back of the unit once to enable pairing and then press scan on the App. You should then see an entry appear in the app. If you do not press re-scan until it appears.

**Step 5:** Press the entry for your hotspot in the app, you can check it is the correct one by matching the last 4 characters shown in the application with the last 4 characters of the mac address printed on the sticker on the bottom of the hotspot.
