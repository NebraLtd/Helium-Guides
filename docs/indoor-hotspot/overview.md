1. **9-16V @ 15W DC 6.5MMx2.0MM Barrel Jack**
2. **LED Indicator.**
3. **Interface Button**
4. **RP-SMA LoRa Connector**
5. **Ethernet Connector**

#### Status Indicator

The Nebra Indoor Hotspot has a status indicator as shown above.

The Top LED will act accordingly:

* Off - Software has not started yet.
* On - Operating as normal
* Slow Blinking - Bluetooth Pairing is enabled
* Fast Blinking - There is potentially a fault. Please check diagnostics page.

The Bottom LED acts accordingly:

* Off - Unit is receiving no power.
* On - Unit is powered up.

#### Button

This is used to re-enable bluetooth pairing on the hotspot, hold the button in for approximately 15 seconds then release to start pairing. The top light should start blinking slowly if successful.

## Firmware

The Nebra Hotspots run a customised software to provide high reliability and ensure your units are as up to date as they can be.

Approximately your hotspot will update once a week in an automatic process, we will announce updates via various social media platforms when they happen.

The software is open source and available on our [Helium Miner Software repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nebraltd/helium-miner-software).

## Unit Information
Each unit has a sticker located on the base of the unit.
