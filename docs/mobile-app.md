You may have read in recent Helium announcements that the existing Helium app will soon **only** be used for the management of the original Helium Hotspot, with a new Helium Wallet app being launched shortly by the core Helium team. Alongside this, it will be required that all hotspot manufacturers will need to maintain their own **"maker apps"** which also connect through to their own onboarding server for managing the onboarding of the hotspots.

Initially, our Nebra Hotspot app simply takes over the core functionalities provided by the Helium Hotspot app - onboarding and asserting location.

As we further develop the app over the coming months in 2022, we are planning to add a lot more features including integration and single-sign-on with our Nebra dashboard which will bring remote management of your devices to the app as well as a vast array of diagnostics tools. It also will mean that any future dashboard features are also more readily available in the app.
