## Firmware

The RockPi Indoor Helium Hotspot runs a customizd software to provide high reliability and ensure your units are as up to date as they can be.

Your hotspot will update approximately  once a week in an automatic process, we will announce updates via various social media platforms when they happen.

The software is open source and available on our [Helium Miner Software repo on GitHub](https://github.com/nebraltd/helium-miner-software).

## Unit Information
Each unit has a sticker located on the base of the unit.
