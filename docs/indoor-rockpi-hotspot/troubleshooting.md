### How to access the diagnostics

On the Nebra Helium Hotspots, we have two local diagnostics tools that can help you to find any issues with your miners.

Please take a look at the dedicated [local diagnostics page](../handy-guides/local-diagnostics.md) for more information.

### No lights are turning on

You should see the lower light (Amber light) on the side of the unit turn on as soon as power is applied. If this is the case, ensure the power supply is firmly plugged into the wall outlet, the power jack is plugged into the unit and that the wall outlet is switched on.

To Do

* Power adapater is connected correctly
* Try a different power adaptor if available (12V 2.5A USB-C Power Adapter)

Upon power up the lower LED (yellow) should light up instantly. Approximately after a minute the top LED (green) should then start blinking.

### Green activity light is off

The Green light is the acivity light and it should turn on solid in normal oppertaion.

Approximately after a minute the top LED (green) should then start blinking. If not, contact customer support with hotspot details.

### The Green LED is blinking rapidly with few seconds intervall

The upper light on the back of the unit blinks rapidly with a few seconds interval. This is expected behaviour. If this is the case, use your web browser to access the diagnostic page of the hotspot. If the diagnostic page does not show any error, everything is fine.

### Hotspot is not showing in the Helium App

It can sometimes take 1-3 minute from turning the power on for the Hotspot to show in the App.

To Do

* Wait for the hotspot to boot up before pairing (Wait 5 minutes)
* Re-scanning a few times can then find the hotspot.
* Ensure Bluetooth is turned on as this is how the application communicates with your Hotspot.

Please note: You will need to grant location permissions for the Application to access Bluetooth services correctly.

### Hotspot is not detecting Wi-Fi networks

You may find that sometimes your Wi-Fi network will not show in the application if the signal is poor where the Hotspot is located.

Please note, Nebra Indoor hotspot only support **2.4G Wifi network.**

To Do

* Check [local diagnostics page](../handy-guides/local-diagnostics.md) and confirm wifi MAC address is listed.
* Remove special characters and emoticons from wifi name/SSID
* Check WiFi have good coverage where you placed the hotspot.
* Try different WiFi network.

### Updating Nebra Hotspot Firmware

If after completing the initial troubleshooting steps above, you are still having issues, you may find your issues can be resolved by ensuring it is running the latest up-to-date software.

Nebra Hotspots automatically update once connected to the internet, if you are using an Ethernet connection leaving the hotspot for around half an hour should ensure all updates are downloaded.

If you are having difficulties connecting your Hotspot to Wi-Fi, then it would be recommended to move it to a location where you can plug it into an Ethernet connection for half an hour to let it perform updates. Then move it back to the normal location and re-try setup.

### Syncing Issues

The Helium Syncing Process sometimes takes some time. Some customers report that the hotspot takes multiple days to sync properly. This is not so much an issue with Nebra, rather an issue with the Helium blockchain itself. Please allow the hotspot to take some time, especially during the 90% mark. If you are still having trouble, feel free to contact support below. If you are not familiar with Nebra's diagnostics page, we highly recommend connecting to your hotspot directly using the local IP address in combination with a web browser. This will provide more insight between the device, and the Helium blockchain.

Please note, Nebra will provide an instant sync feature that download a new snapshot on startup and If you ever find your hotspot more than 300 blocks behind according to the local IP diagnostics you should reboot the hotspot.

### Onboarding key is missing error

Please contact our tech support via sales@nebra.com and provide your MAC address. We will update the onboarding key for you.

### Hotspot not witnessing

Hotspot will not get witness with various reasons from device loation to device relayed.

To Do

* check your antenna connector/ cable and make sure everything connected well.
* Improve the antenna placement/ place it as high as possible - check our [Ideal Hotspot Placement](../handy-guides/hotspot-ideal-location.md)
