## Can I use a different antenna with the Outdoor Hotspot?


Yes you can. Please check the [antenna connections](../handy-guides/antenna/connections.md) guide for more information on the necessary adpaters, connection types and setup.


## Can I add 4G connectivity to the Outdoor Hotspot?


You can add an optional 4G module to the outdoor hotspot, this is a module that is simple to install when you receive your hotspot. We have an [LTE Config page](outdoor-hotspot/lte-config.md) which guides you through the setup process for this module.


## Do I have to add 4G Connectivity and Does 4G increase earnings?


No, the 4G module is an optional extra. By standard, the outdoor hotspot has both Ethernet and WiFi connectivity.

A 4G connection does not increase your HNT earnings.



## Does the 4G Module require a SIM card?


Yes you will need to sign up to a data plan with a mobile network. You can find more details about seeing up 4G with the outdoor gateway on the [LTE Config page](../outdoor-hotspot/lte-config.md).

We recommend this as it is typically cheaper to sign up to a local plan than the worldwide sims we could ship with it.
  
Often, cheaper SIM plans do not have a dedicated IP address and use something called [CGNAT (carrier grade network address translation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) which will mean it will be nearly impossible for you to remove the "relayed" status from your miner and to correctly set up [port forwarding](../handy-guides/port-forwarding/overview.md). For this reason, we recommend that you try to find a business SIM plan that comes with a dedicated public IP address.



## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?


Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month so recommend a 50GB plan when using 4G.

The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.
  
Once all hotspots become "light hotspots" this data usage will reduce.



## What antenna is included with the Hotspot?



For the outdoor hotspot we are including a 3dBi glass fiber antenna. This antenna, and upgraded ones, can be [purchased separately from our website](https://www.nebra.com/collections/antennas).


## Does the Wi-Fi module have an external antenna?


Yes, we include a white N-type WiFi antenna with the outdoor hotspot. This screws to the connector on the bottom of the case, next to the ethernet input gland.



## How long does it take for my Hotspot to sync with the network?



This can vary depending on your internet connection speed. However, in our testing it takes approximately 24-48 hours for the initial synchronisation to be completed.
