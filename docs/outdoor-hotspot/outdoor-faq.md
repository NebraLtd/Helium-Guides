# Outdoor Hotspot FAQs

## Can I use a different antenna with the Outdoor Hotspot?

## Can I add 4G connectivity to the Outdoor Hotspot?

You can add an optional 4G module to the outdoor hotspot, this is a module that is simple to install when you receive your hotspot. We'll have a guide on how to do this at </outdoor-hotspot/lte-config>

## Do I have to add 4G Connectivity / Does 4G Increase Earnings?

No, the 4G Module is an optional

## Does the 4G Module require a sim-card?

Yes you will need to sign up to a data plan with a mobile network. You can find more details about seeing up 4G with the outdoor gateway on the [LTE Config page](outdoor-hotspot/lte-config.md).

We recommend this as it is typically cheaper to sign up to a local plan than the worldwide sims we could ship with it.

## How much internet data per month does the Hotspot use?

Currently we are roughly estimating 30-50GB per month so recommend a 50GB plan when using 4G.

The actual usage may be slightly less or more and will be something we up-date over time as we start measuring more units.

## What antenna is included with the Hotspot?

For the outdoor hotspot we are including a 3dBm glass fiber antenna which can also be [purchased separately from our website](https://www.nebra.com/products/rakwireless-glass-fiber-lora-gateway-antenna).

## Does the Wi-Fi module have an external antenna?

No, we are including a more basic Wi-Fi adaptor which is suitable for short range, you can potentially replace the wi-fi adaptor with one with this ability.

### How long does it take for my Hotspot to sync with the network?

This can vary depending on your internet connection's speed, However in our testing it takes approximately 24-48 hours for the initial synchronisation to be completed.
