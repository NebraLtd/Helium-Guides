11. Micro Sim Card Slot - For use with 3G/4G Module in M-PCIE slot
12. Lora Module Connector - Designed for use with select M-PCIE LoRa Concentrators, these only have wired up SPI, plus GPS PPS from the GPS Module.
13. GPS Module - NEO-6M GPS module, connected to UART1 on the compute module. Plus PPS signal to LoRa modules for accurate timings. **PLEASE NOTE: this is not used by the Nebra Helium Hotspots and is only present on the first batch.**
14. Daughterboard Connector - Connects to Compute Module Daughterboard.

**Status LEDS**

The mainboard has 3 Status LEDs which do the following:

* 12V LED - Indicates the mainboard has power located near the jumper.
* 5V LED - Indicates the 5V regulator is operational located in the power section.
* 3V3 LED - Indicates the 3V3 regulator is operational located in the power section.

#### Daughterboard Overview

The standard daughterboard supports both the Compute Module 3 and Compute Module 3+ (including Lite) variants.

While also compatible with the CM1 we recommend using the CM3 / CM3+ / CM3 Lite / CM3+ Lite for the extra power and RAM as well as larger onboard storage options.

#### Status Indicator

The Nebra Outdoor Hotspot has a status indicator called LED1 on the Wifi daughterboard in the middle of the hotspot

This indicator is RED and will act accordingly:

* Off - Software has not started yet.
* On - Operating as normal
* Slow Blinking - Bluetooth Pairing is enabled
* Fast Blinking - There is potentially a fault. Please check diagnostics page.

#### Button

The Nebra Outdoor Hotspot has a button on the Wifi daughterboard in the middle of inside teh hotspot. This is labeled S1

![DaughterboardBreakdown](../media/photos/outdoor/Outdoor_button.jpg)

This is used to re-enable bluetooth pairing on the hotspot, hold the button in for approximately 15 seconds then release to start pairing. The adjacent status light LED1 should start blinking slowly if successful.

## Firmware

The Nebra Hotspots run a customised software to provide high reliability and ensure your units are as up to date as they can be.

Approximately your hotspot will update once a week in an automatic process, we will announce updates via various social media platforms when they happen.

The software is open source at https://github.com/nebraltd/helium-miner-software
